.SH NAME
dustbuster \- Limit a command to the lifetime of the current login session
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdustbuster\fP \fIprogname\fP [ \fB\-S\fP ] [ \fB\-s\fP \fIsigname\fP ]
\fIarguments\fP ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dustbuster
runs the specified command as a progress group leader, and ensures
that the resulting process group receives a specified signal when the
current login session is over.  The default signal is SIGHUP.
.PP
If the environment variable XSESSION is set (it is set by the Athena
default xsession script), then
.B dustbuster
determines when the current login session is over by opening a
connection to the default X display and waiting for it to be closed.
If the environment variable XSESSION is not set, then
.B dustbuster
periodically (once every five seconds) checks to see whether the
controlling tty can be opened.
.PP
The
.B \-s
option specifies which signal to send when the login session is over.
The signal may be specified by number or by name; if specified by
name, the name may be given with or without leading "SIG", and case is
ignored.
.PP
The
.B \-S
option makes the new process a session leader as well as a process
group leader.
.SH BUGS
Because Unix provides no portable way to map a signal name to signal
number, only the signal names defined by the 1996 POSIX.1 standard are
understood: ABRT, ALRM, FPE, HUP, ILL, INT, KILL, PIPE, QUIT, SEGV,
TERM, USR1, USR2, CHLD, CONT, STOP, TSTP, TTIN, TTOU, BUS.
