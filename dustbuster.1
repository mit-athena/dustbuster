.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dustbuster \fIprogname\fP \fIarguments\fP ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dustbuster
runs the specified command, and ensures that the resulting process
receives a SIGHUP when the current login session is over.
.PP
If the environment variable XSESSION is set (it is set by the Athena
default xsession script), then
.B dustbuster
determines when the current login session is over by opening a
connection to the default X display and waiting for it to be closed.
If the environment variable XSESSION is not set, then
.B dustbuster
periodically (once every five seconds) checks to see whether the
controlling tty can be opened.
